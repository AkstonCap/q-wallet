# Nexus Wallet Icons

To generate the icons for the extension:

1. Open `generate-icons.html` in your browser
2. The icons will be automatically generated
3. Right-click each canvas image and save as PNG
4. Save them in this folder with these names:
   - icon16.png
   - icon32.png
   - icon48.png
   - icon128.png

Alternatively, you can create your own custom icons with these specifications:

- **icon16.png**: 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- **icon32.png**: 32x32 pixels (retina toolbar icon)
- **icon48.png**: 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- **icon128.png**: 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store, installation)

## Design Guidelines

- Use the Nexus blue color scheme (#0066ff to #0052cc gradient)
- Include the "N" letter or Nexus logo
- Ensure icons are clear and recognizable at all sizes
- Use transparent background or solid background
- Keep design simple and professional

## Temporary Solution

Until you create proper icons, the extension will use the default browser extension icon. The extension will still function normally, but having custom icons will make it look more professional.
